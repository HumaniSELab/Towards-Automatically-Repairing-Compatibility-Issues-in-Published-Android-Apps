# Towards-Automatically-Repairing-Compatibility-Issues-in-Published-Android-Apps

The heavy fragmentation of the Android ecosystem has led to severe compatibility issues with apps. We propose a generic approach that aims at fixing several types of compatibility issues in released Android apps. Our prototype tool, RepairDroid, provides a generic app patch description language for users to create fix templates for compatibility issues. The created templates will then be leveraged by RepairDroid to fix the corresponding issue at the bytecode level automatically.
